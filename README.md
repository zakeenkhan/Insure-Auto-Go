## Tools Used for this Update

To update this `README.md` file, I used the following tools:

1.  `find_by_name`: To locate the `README.md` file and all the image files within the project.
2.  `view_file`: To read the contents of the `README.md` and `package.json` files to understand the project structure and technologies.
3.  `replace_file_content`: To replace the old `README.md` content with this new, more detailed version.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
